# Capstone Pitch
capstone 00 - wireframes - #30

The vision for this project starts with understanding the problem of functional fixedness. As we as individuals go on about our lives, we must invariable engage our current economic system. As experiments like the candle problem have shown as we work to address problems in our life and business the reward aspect of money is a surprisingly harsh dampener on creativity, our ability to think outside the box which is what is required to solve some of the more difficult problems in the world today and in our personal lives isn't as powerful as we'd like to be. How we will achieve our long term goals is such a problem as to require a creative solution more often than not. As we are paid for our work in whatever we do it’s important that we keep a regular tap on our current passions, lessons, where we want to go and whom we wish to become. To keep in sight our evolving dreams and what we are working toward. 

The Capstone, Compass (long term goal app) was something I wished to exist for my own sake. Combining my passions and interests in the hopes to achieve some of what I set out to do so many years ago. To combine multiple studies worth of groundbreaking findings, of which have turned some of our long held assumptions economically and otherwise on their heads. To incorporate our current understanding of habitual processes, conditioning and learning. 

To have a Daily Journal section which will have questions that pertain to /  creating balance and intention as well as locking import understands into one’s frame of reference. A google synced calender, List of To-Dos and Long-Term goals to keep in sight what we are working toward. (on the first iteration)
